# Intro
I love firing up SPICE simualtion for circuits. Over the years I tried to simulate all kinds of circuits I encountered for better understanding, which I plan to have a look back, re-do simulation with latest tools, and organize better to share it. 

There are many great free tools available on market, within then [QSpice](https://p.qorvo.com/qspice-simulator.html) that only launched not long ago is my favorite for circuit and Power Converter simulation. However I may use all of the great SPICE simulator below whence suitable. 

- [QSpice](https://p.qorvo.com/qspice-simulator.html)
- [LtSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)
- [PSpice-for-TI](https://www.ti.com/tool/PSPICE-FOR-TI), it's sometimes required for TI's encrypted devices

Despite not exactly a SPICE simulator, [Simplis](https://www.simplistechnologies.com/) is a great tool for power converter control loop design and I plan to explore its potential in the daily work. Simplis provides a free-to-download version and it franchise it to many partners. Any of below simulators should be able to run the Simplis simulations without much problems. SiMetrix is a powerful SPICE tool shipping together with Simplis, but most of the time I'm happy with other free simulators without circuit size limitations.

- [Microchip's MPLAB Mindi](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/analog-development-tool-ecosystem/mplab-mindi-analog-simulator), mainly target for Analog simulation
- [Maxim's EE-SIM OASIS](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ee-sim.html), now belongs to ADI
- [MPS' MPSmart](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/mpsmart-v9.html)
- [Renesas' iSim:PE](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/software-tool/isimpe-offline-simulation-tool)
